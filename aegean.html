        Aegean Airlines is the flag carrier of Greece. This Star Alliance airline maintains an operational strategy and focus of mostly regional flights. Unfortunately, Aegean Airlines doesn’t operate any flights to/from the U.S. This isn’t terribly surprising, as the country as a whole is still recovering from a historic sovereign debt crisis.
